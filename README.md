CharliNLP
=========

Charli is an NLP chat bot I developed in 2009. It uses simple rules, wikitionary, wordnet, and freebase with a MySQL backend.

I lost the backend database over the years, but I'm pretty sure it's all in dump.sql also I lost all the graphics.

This repo is just a record of the code I wrote, so as not to lose it, rather than having any significant use now.
